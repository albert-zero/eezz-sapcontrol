 <h1>SAP Management Console</h1>
 <h2>Introduction</h2>
 <p>
	 You can add snapshots generated by sapcontrol and SAP-MMC or life links to the console view.
	 The life links interact with the view to update the display status.
 </p>
 
 <h2>Startup</h2>
 <p>
	 The console starts with three sections.
	 <ul>
		 <li>Left: Tree Navigation</li>
		 <li>Upper Right: Commands View</li>
		 <li>Lower Right: Data View</li>
	 </ul>
	 
	 If the first column is not empty, it contains a handle to expand or collaps a tree segment.
	 A click on the other columns will open a view in the upper right console window with more commands on the selected element.
	 Tree elements in this view have a context menu, which opens if you select an entry. A context menu closes, if you chick into 
	 the table, no matter if you select an activity.

<p>
     The data section displays a navigation bar, if the number of entries exceed a given threshold. Only a very limited 
     number of elements are rendered for output, which ensures maximal perfomrance.
